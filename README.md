Welcome to today’s learning. Today we will create a Responsive Online Learning Website Design. We create the website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Prerequisite:

For this project, you need good knowledge of HTML and CSS. Some basic knowledge of CSS flex and grid layouts. Also, you need to have basic javascript knowledge.

Website Features:

The website consists of 5 main sections – The hero section, features section, popular courses, testimonials, download app. These sections are completely responsive. We also have a responsive header and footer section.

The navbar is responsive with a subtle hover effect. The navbar collapses into side nav on mobile and tablet versions.

The header has a sticky effect on it.

The features section has a beautiful hover effect.

It also consists of a ‘scroll top button’ placed at the bottom right of the webpage that takes the user to the top of the webpage smoothly.
